<!--You are tasked by Wikipedia to write a JS program that parses text according to their internal markup in the browser. Your program will receive a selector to a paragraph of text and has to scan it for special symbol combinations that denote specific style for the text that is enclosed in them. For instance, text surrounded by double single quotes (''text'') must be displayed in italics. Look bellow for a full list of features.-->
